## Introduction

This project implements the programming project MAGOS, which is composed of some subprojects:
Canvas, Maze, Render, Builder, Solver.

## Structure

The folder and files structure is the following:

* `include` folder contains the headers of classes

* `helpers` folder contains other resources useful to implementation

* `src` folder contains the implementation of the classes

* `test` folder contains codes to test classes and other codes

* `build` folder will contain compilation files generated with help of CMake

* `run` folder will contain the executables generated

* `data` folder will contain data used by the project, like images, configurations, inputs, ouputs, etc

	* `builder` folder will contain imagens generated by the builder application
	* `solver` folder will contain imagens generated by the solver application

## Compilation

You can go to root directory of the project and:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Or, if you would like to do all from root:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -H. -Bbuild
$ make -C build/ --no-print-directory
```

## Execution

All executables will be placed in `run/` folder. So, you can run typing:

```
$ ./run/[EXECUTABLE]
```

## Doxygen

A configuration file is set in the root directory, `doxygen.cfg`. If you want to generate yours, you can type:

```
$ doxygen -g [NAME]
```

Its recommended to custom the following tags: PROJECT\_NAME, OUTPUT\_DIRECTORY and EXTRACT\_PRIVATE.

## TODO

* On class `Maze`
	[*] introduce `valid_coord()` in `to_index()` and `get_cell()`, and implement exceptions
	[*] implement methods to get states of cells and walls
	[*] refactor order of bits: four first to be walls states
	[*] turn Cell type back to private
	[*] refactor method to reset states in `set_state()`
	[ ] refactor number of bits used, from 8 to 6

* On class `Render`
	[*] refactor `draw_cell()` to use methods provided by Maze
	[ ] document with details

* On class `MagosGame`

* Implement `Builder` and `Solver` classes (each class name will refer to the method used)
	[*] class `HashBuilder`

* On class `HashBuilder`
	[*] introduce render object
	[*] save snapshots of maze
	[*] remove internal render and receive it by parameter
	[*] create `step()` method
	[ ] rename class `roulette` and port it to inside `HashBuilder`
	[ ] implement Hash Table as a `std::vector` (internal class)

* On class `HashTable`
	[*] implement exceptions ( `key2index()`, `merge\_by\_key()` )
	[*] document with details
	[*] separate `build\_maze()` to `build\_maze()` + `build\_step()` (use class `Roulette`?)
	[ ] delete statement on destructor

* On class `Solver`

* General
	[ ] improve comments
