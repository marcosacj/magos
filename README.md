* `test` folders contain codes to test classes and other codes:

	* `test_canvas`
	* `test_maze`
	* `test_render`
	* `test_solver`

* `build` folders will contain compilation files generated with help of CMake:

	* `build_canvas`
	* `build_maze`
	* `build_render`
	* `build_solver`

* `run` folder will contain the executables generated

* `data` folder will contain data used by the project, like images, configurations, inputs, ouputs, etc

	* `builder` folder will contain imagens generated by the builder application
